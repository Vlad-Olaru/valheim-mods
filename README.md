# Shieldwall Skald  
Welcome to **Shieldwall Skald**, our very own Valheim server and custom modpack! This is where we, a group of some friends, come together to explore, build, fight, and share adventures in the Viking afterlife.  

For a while now, we've been venturing through Valheim‚Äôs vast landscapes, taking on trolls, sailing across stormy seas, and building glorious settlements, sharing laughs, triumphs, and the occasional death-scream when a Deathsquito shows up uninvited. Now, with our custom modpack, we've taken things to the next level! Whether it's crafting, farming, exploring, or battling, these mods enhance our gameplay experience and let us create even greater tales of Viking legend.  

We hope it inspires us (and maybe others!) to keep building, exploring, and conquering in this incredible game.  

If you're here, you're either one of us, or you're curious about what mods we're using. Either way, welcome to the saga of **Shieldwall Skald**!
